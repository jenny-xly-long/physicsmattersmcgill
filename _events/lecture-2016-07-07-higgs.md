*Abstract:*

In 2012, the discovery of the Higgs Boson by the two main experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland provided an extraordinary occasion for particle physics to make the headlines. However, the subject of fundamental particle physics and the importance of such a ground-breaking discovery is not always easy to relate to in our every day lives. This talk will attempt to assemble the building blocks of the universe into a coherent package and explain the central position of the Higgs boson in it all. I will also outline the consequences of having found a new boson and what lies ahead in the future for particle physicists in their attempt to answer the big questions.
