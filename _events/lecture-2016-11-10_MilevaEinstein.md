*Abstract:*

What were Albert Einstein's first wife’s contributions to his extraordinary productivity in the first years of his career? The first biography of Mileva Marić was published in Serbian in 1969 and remained largely unknown until it was translated first in German, then in French in the 1990’s. A doubt has subsisted ever since. More recent sources have shed more light on her life, allowing us to finally get a better idea on the contributions of Mileva Marić.
