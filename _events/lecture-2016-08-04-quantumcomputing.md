*Abstract:*

For the past 50 years, computational power has doubled (at the same cost) roughly every two years. This incredible technological progress has been achieved through a strategy of shrinking the size of electronic components down to an almost unimaginable size. Current transistors are only roughly 100 atoms on a side. As the size of electronic components approaches the atomic scale, new quantum-mechanical laws become important and must be taken into account. However, by redesigning computers to take advantage of quantum properties, we can make them far more powerful.

Find out why governments around the world as well as Microsoft, IBM, and Google are investing heavily into research in quantum technology. When will we get quantum computers and what could we do with one?
