We are able to host school or extracurricular groups at our department at McGill University. We have a variety of activities for all ages, offered in French or English. Typical visits vary in length, and may involve museum tours, lab tours, short demos, or hands-on activities. [Contact us]("mailto:{{ site.email }}") for information or to request a visit. Visit date and language are subject to volunteer availability.
