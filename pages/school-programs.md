Our volunteers visit local classrooms for single or multiple visits. Our main effort in this area is the Space Explorers program for primary schools.

## Space Explorers program

In this program, pairs of physicists visit local primary schools around 5 times over the course of the school year, bringing along a different physics activity on each hour-long visit. Students get to know a physicist, while doing inquiry-based activities and experiments. Students participating in this program will investigate physics concepts like gravity, collisions, and heat. They will also practice using scientific tools like modeling, collecting data, and analyzing results. At the end of the program, students have completed their "training" to become junior Space Explorers! Activities may include:
- Heat & temperature
- Collisions
- Gravity
- Magnetism
- Light & Color
- Sink or Float
- Forces & Friction (New)

The Space Explorers program (formerly Adopt an Astronomer) was started in September 2015, and has since grown to include around 6 classrooms each year, reaching approximately 100 students from ages 9 to 12 (grades 4 - 6).
