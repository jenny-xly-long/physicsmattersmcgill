The Anna I. McPherson Lectures in Physics were established in honour of Anna Isobel McPherson, a member of the McGill Physics Faculty from 1940 until her death in 1979. Over her long association with the Department of Physics, Anna McPherson made important contributions in teaching, research, and counselling, helping and teaching a very large number of students. The McPherson lecture series was established to acknowledge her outstanding generosity and her many valued academic contributions. The mandate of these lectures is to bring a distinguished physicist to McGill each year to give two lectures, one of which is a lecture for the general public.

A list of the previous lectures in the series can be found [here](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/outreach/mcpherson.html). More information about Anna McPherson and the McPherson collection of early 20th century experimental apparatus, can be found [here](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/museum/anna_mcpherson.htm).
