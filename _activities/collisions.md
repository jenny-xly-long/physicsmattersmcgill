## Preparation
This activity makes use of "shape colliders." The shape colliders are made by creating different shapes, each about 1 inch thick, which are attached to the bottom of round disks which hide the shape from view.
- Prepare the shape colliders
- Do the activity on a large, flat table, or move chairs and tables out of the way so activity can be done on the floor.

## Materials
- hula hoops (1 per group)
- shape colliders (1-2 per group)
- large sheets or roll of paper
- marbles
- pens
- tape
