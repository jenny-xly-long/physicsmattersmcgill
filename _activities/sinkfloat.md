title: "Sink or Float"

age: 8-12
objective: "Discover how factors like mass, volume, and shape affect the ability of an object to float."
objective_fr: “”
summary: “Through this activity, the students will be introduced to the scientific method and will make use of it to determine that density affects an object’s ability to float. The students will be given various objects of different volumes, shapes and masses and will be asked to perform 3 trials, each of which will have one variable (i.e. varying mass and leaving volume and shape constant). Then let them perform at least 2 trials and determine which objects float and which ones sink. Ask them if there”
