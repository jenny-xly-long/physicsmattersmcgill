## Materials
- plastic boxes with attached eye hooks (1 per group)
- cord tied to s-hooks (1 length per group)
- washers (around 10 per group)
- table clamp pulley (optional, 1 per group)

## Alternative Materials
If table clamp pulleys are not available, the cord can hang over the edge of a table, or a book placed at the edge of the table.

## Preparation

## Experiment 1: what is a force?

## Experiment 2: can you get the box to move more slowly?

## Experiment 3: how does mass affect motion?

## Experiment 4: how does friction affect motion?
